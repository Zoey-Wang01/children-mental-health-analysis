      "Type I Diabetes Mellitus (DM I) is the third most common chronic childhood disease and can cause both short-term and long-term complications, as well as acute life-threatening events. The announcement of the DM I diagnosis in childhood or adolescence constitutes a major psychosocial stressor for the child and his family. Diabetes in general complicates the parent-child relationship and increases adolescents’negative thoughts about themselves and depressive mood. The majority of patients experience depressive and/or anxiety symptoms at thetime of diagnosis, which generally resolve withinsix to nine months. Poor adjustment in this initial phase places adolescents at risk for later psychosocial difficulties. On a long-term basis, individuals with DM I may exhibit significant psychiatric and behavioral problems including depression, anxiety and anger. We here reported the case of a 13-year-old boy, suffering from DM I for 3 years, who developed poor metabolic control, depressive symptoms and life-threatening behavior in the past 6 months and was hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric unit. The complex biopsychosocial needs of adolescents with Type I Diabetes Mellitus should be recognized and addressed through tailored interventions by medical and mental health professionals.\n"
