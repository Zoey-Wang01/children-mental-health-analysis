This was a qualitative research guided by the social phenomenology of Al-fred Schütz. 13 health professionals from CAPSi between November 2008 and January 2009 were interviewed. We identified three categories: First feelings, difficulties of care and motivation for the care. The first category, awakened feelings, relates to the beginning of work with children and adolescents in CAPSi. The second motivation for the care, relates to the points highlighted as conducive to work. The third, difficulties in Caring for expressing the difficulties encountered in mental health of children and adolescents in CAPSi. We concluded that the care depends of knowledge, experience and service conditions in order to attend the needs of children and adolescents in CAPSi."

The sample consisted of 391 disable Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip which was selected randomly from the data base of two NGOs working with such group of children. The age of children ranged from 6 - 18 years with mean age (11.73). Instruments: The children and adolescents demographic data were collected by questionnaire include sex, age, class, and place of residence, Gaza Child Health Study Scales (parents and children forms), and The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory generic core (version 4.0) scale. The results showed that children reported mean conduct disorder was 1.33; oppositional disorder was 5; mean overanxious was 6.75; separation anxiety mean was 6.36; and depression was 7.57. There were statistically significant differences toward boys in depression. According to parents, mean conduct disorder mean was 1.94; mean oppositional disorder was 6.09; mean overanxious was 7.47; separation anxiety mean was 6.48; and mean depression was 9.6. The study showed that mean depression in boys was 10.4 compared to 8.9 in girls. There were statistically significant differences toward boys in depression. Parents of children with physical disabilities reported more overanxious problems in their children compared to other parents with other types of disabilities (vision, mental, and multiple). Also, parents of children with physical disability had more separation anxiety than other groups (mental and multiple disabilities). Quality of life of children was scored by children themselves; mean emotional functioning was 8.24; mean social functioning was 6.65; school functioning mean was 9.17; and cognitive functioning was 8.57. The study showed that mental health problems rated by children such as conduct disorder was positively correlated with emotional and cognitive functioning; oppositional disorder was correlated with emotional, social, and cognitive function; overanxious disorder was correlated emotional, school, and cognitive functioning; separation anxiety was correlated emotional functioning; and depression was correlated emotional, social, and cognitive functioning."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/2663751,"Internet, Physical Health and Mental Health, Children and Youth","The purpose of the research was to study the behavior of children and youth related to using the internet. The sample consisted of 1,584 children and youths in Bangkok. The Canonical Correlation Analysis statistics method was applied to analyze the data. The research results revealed that using the internet for entertainment purposes exerted good effects on mental health at 0.52%; meanwhile, it negatively affected mental health at 6251%. Using the internet for education and business displayed effects on physical health only at 650%. In the second part of the research, section one used in-depth interviews with five children and youths, and section two used a personal interview of four executives and experts specifically chosen. From all of the research results, the children and the majority of youths derived more benefits than bad effects. However, using too much internet either positively or negatively would cause some physical and mental health effects. Recommended internet media controls include the following: 1) the government must be part in blocking improper internet and promoting the good internet media; 2) the communities must take part in monitoring bad internet media, both content and images; 3) parents and families must take care and keep an eye on their children; and 4) the mass communication organizations must promote good media and screen the bad media sites."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/5287715,"Psychological Well-Being/Mental Health, “Left behind Children”, Migrant Parents","Background:In Asia, especially in China and ASEAN,ithas been an obvious trend that the population in general and parents in particular leave the countryside to bigger cities or more developed countries for employment opportunities. Many migrant workers are forced to leave their children at home with caregivers, particularly in families with both husband and wife working away from home. Studies worldwide have showed that, besides positive economic and social impacts, labor migrant parents also cause negative effects to the well-being of those they leave behind, especially children. However, this study orientation has not generated significant interest in Vietnam.Participants:This paper indicates the results of a survey on 469 left-behind children of labor migrant parents in rural areas by comparing them with a control group of 650 children living with their parents in three rural areas of North Vietnam including Phu Tho, Bac Ninh and Ha Nam provinces. Besides, we also survey 363 caregivers (parent or grandfather/grandmother of left-behind children) about psychological well-being of left-behind children.Method:Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used for this study. SDQ was Vietnamized by author Dang Hoang Minhet al.(2013) and adaptable to Vietnamese teenagers.Results:As reported by the surveyed children, the SDQ mean total difficulties score of those having migrant parents was 12.55 (SD = 5.96) and 18.9% of these children had scores higher than the cut-off score. As rated by caregivers, they were 11.12 (SD = 5.14) and 15.1%, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference in mental health between the LBC and non-LBC group. The general trend is that the LBC reported to have higher scores of total difficulties and specific expressions"

Distressed, hungry and poorly groomed children can be seen roaming the streets in search for means of survival from well-wishers and passersby. Poverty, cultural practices and religious belief have been cited as being responsible for such problems. The study aimed at determining the sociodemographic factors responsible for children being on the streets. It also seeks to establish the mental health effects of children being on the streets. Two questionnaires were designed by the researchers to collect information about respondents. One hundred and seven (107) of these children were interviewed. The study revealed the predominance of male children (91.6%), children from Islamic background (85.0%) whose parents were involved in unskilled jobs (72.0%). A statistically significant relationship was observed between street life and sociodemographic factors. Over four-fifth of the children have faced various forms of physical, sexual, emotional abuse with about three-quarter involved with alcohol and other drugs. In conclusion, the study revealed that poverty, low family income and large family sizes were responsible for children being on the streets."

https://www.oalib.com/paper/2981904,"Obesity, Children, Adolescents, Mental Health, Statistical Modelling","A number of studies have reported significant associations between obesity and poor psychological wellbeing in children but findings have been inconsistent. Methods: This study utilised data from 3,898 children aged 5-16 years obtained from the Health Survey for England 2007. Information was available on Body Mass Index (BMI), parental ratings of child emotional and behavioural health (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), self-reported physical activity levels and sociodemographic variables. A multilevel modelling approach was used to allow for the clustering of children within households. Results: Curvilinear relationships between both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) symptoms and adjusted BMI were observed. After adjusting for potential confounders the relationships between obesity and psychological adjustment (reported externalising and internalising symptoms) remained statistically significant. Being overweight, rather than obese, had no impact on overall reported mental health. 17% of children with obesity were above the suggested screening threshold for emotional problems, compared to 9% of non-obese children. Allowing for clustering and potential confounding variables children classified as obese had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.13 (95% CI 1.39 to 3.26) for being above the screening threshold for an emotional disorder compared to non-obese young people. No cross-level interactions between household income and the relationships between obesity and internalising or externalising symptoms were observed. Conclusions: In this large, representative, UK-based community sample a curvilinear association with emotional wellbeing was observed for adjusted BMI suggesting the possibility of a threshold effect. Further research could focus on exploring causal relationships and developing targeted interventions."

https://www.oalib.com/paper/5292728,"Sleep Problems, Children, Adolescents, Mental Health, Media Use","This study explored characteristics of sleep and other presenting problems in children and adolescents seeking mental health services within an outpatient clinic. Primary caregivers seeking outpatient mental health services for their children between the ages of 2 - 18 completed a measure assessing various aspects of their children’s sleep, emotional and behavioral problems, and use of electronics at bedtime. Results showed reduced sleep durations compared to recommended guidelines. Results also indicated that sleep duration was negatively associated with the total number of problems listed for both the youngest and school aged groups. Children and adolescents with worries and fears, irritability, and mood swings had significantly less sleep, and participants with sadness had longer sleep latencies. Regarding use of electronics, participants with televisions in the bedroom reported significantly less hours of sleep than those without. The average number of hours of television watched per week was positively correlated with the number of minutes of sleep latency, while videogame usage was negatively correlated with sleep duration. The study results indicated that sleep disturbances are significant issues impacting youth who are experiencing mental health issues. These results also emphasize the importance of a thorough sleep assessment for children who present for mental health services."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/6117053,"Adolescent Health, Mental Health, Peer-Led Approach, Sexual Reproductive Health","Background:India being the country with largest adolescent population in the world, needs a special focus on the health services as the status of an adolescent determines the health status in his/her adulthood. Some of the major issues faced by the adolescents include: mental health problems, early pregnancy and childbirth, (HIV/STI) and other infectious diseases, violence, injuries and malnutrition. The present study aims to understand the effectiveness of peer-led intervention on knowledge, attitude and practices related to sexual reproductive and mental health issues in adolescents among participants and non-participants. The study was carried out to improve the health-seeking behaviour of adolescents on sexual reproductive and mental health issues in low resource setting across four states in India.Methods:The study adopted a cross-sectional survey which was conducted on 400 adolescents from each of the four districts namely Bangalore, Khagaria-Bihar, Khed-Pune and Sahinganj-Jharkhand. A comparative analysis was conducted between the participants and the non-participants of the intervention to understand the effectiveness of the intervention on the KAP related to sexual reproductive and mental health of adolescents.Results:The study shows that the participants from Karnataka and Maharashtra had better knowledge in emergency contraception, HIV awareness, use of contraceptives and consumption of IFA’s than the non-participants; both the participants and the non-participants showed a positive behaviour in help-seeking in case of psychological challenges.Conclusion:The peer-led approach was found to be an effective strategy for learning, sharing and monitoring adolescent sexual reproductive and mental health."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/3151374,"Health Promotion, Heart Rate Variability, Mental Health, School-Aged Children","Many health promotion programs have been implemented to prevent obesity and mental health problems among school-aged children. However, only a few programs included both physical and psychological measures to assess the effects of the program. The present study was designed to test the effects of a 6-week health promotion program on physical and mental health among school-aged children using physiological and psychological measures. A total of 74 elementary school students (4thand 5thgrade) recruited from urban (n = 51) and rural areas (n = 23) participated in the study. We used the Korean version of the Kovacs’ Children’s Depression Inventory and the Conners-Wells’ Adolescent Self-Report Scale-Short Form (CASS-S) to measure levels of depression and hyperactivity, respectively. To assess children’s physical health, we measured body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and heart rate variability. In addition, children’s health-related behaviors (e.g., eating and exercise habits) were assessed using the health promotion behavior scale. A total of 63 students (13 in the experimental and 50 in the control group) who completed both physiological and psychological measures were included in the final analysis. Compared to children in the control group, children in the experimental group showed a significant decrease in their level of hyperactivity (t = -2.01,p= 0.049) and increase in heart rate variability (t = -2.35,p= 0.022). No significant group differences were noted for depression, BMI, body fat percentage, and health promotion behaviors between the two groups. Findings of this study provided preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of a 6-week school-based health promotion program for improving emotional health among school-aged children living in a rural area. Future studies testing the effects of health promotion programs with longer sessions and programs focusing on social-emotional skill development are needed."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/2804659,"Child and Adolescent Mental Health, challenges, global","Child and adolescent mental health is an essential component of overall health and its importance is gaining increased recognition. Current events have heightened an interest in the mental health of youth. Unfortunately, too often this is due to concerns about the mental health consequences of war, prolonged conflict, natural disasters, AIDS, and substance abuse. Special populations of repatriated child soldiers and street children are a vivid reminder of the many children who have been deprived of an environment that could support healthy development. Further, there is an increased understanding that children who are not mentally healthy can have an adverse impact on the stability and economic viability of nations. Of particular importance throughout the world is the fact that positive mental health plays a role in supporting compliance and adherence with a broad spectrum of health regimens."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/6794388,"留守儿童，心理健康，发育延迟，情感忽视，儿童抑郁Left-Behind Children, Mental Health, Development Delay, Emotional Neglect, Child Depression","留守儿童是伴随社会快速发展及父母外出打工而出现的弱势群体，由于数量庞大，受到了广泛的社会关注。已有研究发现，留守经历会对留守儿童的心理健康、社会适应、人格成长、学业与家庭等诸多方面产生消极的影响，其中最突出的问题主要包括早期分离导致儿童社会情绪发育延迟、父母缺席导致的情感忽视、缺少父母关爱导致儿童抑郁、同伴拒绝导致的孤独感等。规模庞大的留守儿童群体是我国未来劳动力的重要来源，其身心健康状况不仅会直接影响其个人的未来发展，也会影响我国的经济发展和社会稳定，因此关注留守儿童的身心健康具有重要意义。本文对留守儿童面临的问题进行了总结，并提出了切实可行的建议。Left-behind children are vulnerable groups appearing along with the rapid development of society and their parents’ out-migrantion for work. Due to their large number, they have received wide social attention. Previous studies found that Left-behind experience will have a negative impact on their mental health, social adaptation, personality growth, study and many other aspects. The most prominent problems mainly include early separation causes delayed socio-emotional development in children, parents absent lead to emotional neglect, lack of parents care cause children depression, peers refused to lead to loneliness. The large group of left-behind children is an important source of China’s future labor force. Their physical and mental health will not only directly affect their personal future development, but also affect China’s economic development and social stability. Therefore, it is of great significance to pay attention to the physical and mental health of left-behind children. This paper summarizes the problems faced by left-behind children and puts forward practical suggestions."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/3132835,"Physical Activity, Children, Youth, Mental Health, Community, Coping, Depression","This study examined the influence of a physical activity (PA) program (Move Your Mood)on children and adolescents receiving services in community mental health clinics. Participants (N = 35) were referred to the (PA) program by their mental health therapist. Coaches engaged participants in individual one-on-one and group activity sessions for eight weeks. Participant heart rates were monitored during physical activity sessions and designed to achieve moderate to high intensity. Participants reported significant improvements in mood immediately following physical activity. Measures of motivation to exercise, coping, and depression were taken before program participation, at 4-weeks, and at completion of the 8 week program. Results indicate that the PA program significantly improved child and adolescent ability to cope as well as their intrinsic motive to exercise. In addition, the PA program significantly reduced self-reported depressive symptoms. Qualitative analysis indicates that social supports and enhanced self-efficacy resulting from physical activity engagement and sessions are key factors associated with program outcomes. The current study provides evidence to support three key psychosocial theories: social interaction, distraction hypothesis, and mastery hypothesis."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/2994003,"Mental Health, Adolescents, Comorbidity, Transdiagnostics, Cognitive Processes","An increase in anxiety, depressed mood and sleep problems has been observed among adolescents. These symptoms have high rates of comorbidity and shared psychological processes have been proposed as maintaining factors. This study examined the occurrence and development of individual profiles of depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleeps problems and investigated them in relation to catastrophic thinking and cognitive avoidance. We used longitudinal data from a community sample of 379 senior high school students at two time points, one year apart. Five clusters were identified: a low scores cluster, a sleep problems cluster, a comorbidity cluster (high on all variables), a low mood cluster and a cluster with elevation on anxiety and depressed mood (“distress”). In general, the clusters showed stability across time. However, for the low mood and “distress” cluster, there was also an increased odds of developing sleep problems. The comorbidity and the “distress” cluster displayed the highest levels of catastrophic thinking. In conclusion, symptom patterns differed among adolescents and were stable over time. Anxiety and/or depressive symptoms were a risk factor for the development of sleep problems. Symptom constellations were related to differences in catastrophic thinking and cognitive avoidance and this may explain maintenance and exacerbation of problems over time."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/3146932,"Children, Family, Mental Health Promotion, Parental Depression, Prevention","Parental depression has a devastating impact on family life and children’s social adjustment and mental health and little information exists as to how parental depression is associated with children’s health-related quality of life. The present paper describes the research protocol of a Greek randomized clinical trial, examining the effectiveness of two preventive interventions (a family intervention and a psychoeducational discussion with parents) for families struggling with parental depression. An important question in this research is what factors can better predict the improvement of child outcomes in these families. Another issue of special interest is to explore the association of children’s health-related quality of life with parental mental health symptoms and to examine to what extent each intervention can have a positive impact on this domain. Sixty-two patients diagnosed with depressive disorders and their offspring aged 8 - 16 years old are randomly assigned to the two intervention groups and they complete a series of questionnaires prior to interventions and 4, 10 and 18 months after intervention. This study will offer an evidence base for developing relevant initiatives in a national level and for integrating preventive actions for child mental health in routine clinical practice with adult depressed patients."

Using data from the 2011/2012 National Survey of Children’s Health, four questions were extracted to measure neighborhood amenities, neighborhood detractors, body mass index, and experience of depression. Ordinal regressions were calculated to estimate the relationships between all variables. The results indicated that over 25% of African-American girls, ages 12 - 14 were overweight and obese with fewer 15 - 17-year-old girls falling within these categories. African-American girls had access to fewer amenities in their communities while at the same time being exposed to more detracting elements within their neighborhoods. Finally over 25% of parents or caregivers reported that girls ages 12 - 17 expressed being depressed in the last 12 months and depression was found to be related to obesity. Overall, African-American adolescent girls tended to live in communities with fewer resources and were at greater risk for being overweight and obese and having poorer mental health outcomes than their white peers. They were also the least likely to receive mental health services. In addition, access to neighborhood amenities had been shown to lead to better health outcomes. Given the positive relationship between neighborhood amenities, access to quality healthcare and health outcomes, local, state, and federal governments should continue to advocate for the provision of resources to communities with a substantial number of detracting elements so as to reduce the health disparities within the community. In addition, psychologists and other health providers should continue to advocate for mental health services for African-American girls who are the least likely to receive them."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/2988128,"Mental Health, Adolescent, Mobile Team, Psychological Mobilization, Changing  Locations, Changing Caregivers, Movement","We have developed a mobile team for adolescents with psychological difficulties that can intervene within 48 hours, if necessary. Practically, caregivers working in pairs go wherever the adolescents are (home, General Practioner’s office, etc.), travelling in a motorhome designed as a mobile office. This method allows us to approach more closely the adolescents and their families in thehere and nowthat corresponds to our societal evolution. Most of the adolescents seen by the mobile team do not express any explicit demand but the demand is expressed by the professionals in direct contact with these adolescents in difficulty (school professionals, General Practitioners, etc.), who alert the mobile team and solicit the adolescents’ parents to call the mobile team. One characteristic of this mobile team is the mobility of setting (by changing locations, including the use of a mobile office, and caregivers, so that multiple representations are mobilized). Statistical analyses conducted on 520 adolescents followed by the mobile team showed that the first meetings tend to take place in the family’s home, subsequently transferring to the mobile office and finally in the community mental health centres. There is therefore a transition from the living space (a place that is part of thehere and now) to the caregiving space (aspaceof thought and for thinking), with the mobile office serving as an intermediate step in this movement towards accessing care. Furthermore, there was a significant association between changes of locations and continuity of care. Thus, there were significantly more breakdowns in continuity when the consultations all take place in a single location (family home, mobile office, community centre). The results and their therapeutic implications will be discussed in this article, especially with regard to the key role played by physical movement in psychological mobilization, and by plurality of representations associated with different locations and caregivers."

We aimed to identify differences in the psychosocial profiles of adolescents who classified themselves as bullies, victims, or bully-victims. We performed a cross-sectional study in which data were collected between January 2009 and January 2010 from seven university-based clinics in a large metropolitan area with a predominantly Mexican-American population. We collected data on physical aggression among adolescents who self-categorized into the following groups: uninvolved, bullies, victims, and bully-victims. We determined the psychosocial profiles of the adolescents based on responses to the Youth Self Report (YSR) and parent’s responses to the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A one-way analysis of variance and multivariate regression analyses were performed to compare the various components of the psychosocial profiles among the groups. Our analysis of the CBCL and the YSR assessments identified differences between the uninvolved group and one or more of the other groups. No significant differences were observed among the bully, victim, and bully-victim groups based on the CBCL. We did find significant differences among those groups based on the YSR, however. Our results suggest that emotional and behavioral problems exist among bullies, victims, and bully-victims. Therefore, treatment should not focus only on the victims of bullying; treatment is equally important for the other groups (bullies and bully-victims). Failure to adequately treat the underlying problems experienced by all three groups of individuals could allow the problems of bullying to continue."

This article provides an overview of the various factors that threaten optimal development of young children living in poverty and that place them at risk for emotional and behavioral problems. The article then addresses the challenges to meeting the needs of these children and their families in early care and education settings. Four key strategies for improving the capacity of early care and education programs for preventing and addressing mental health problems in young children in poverty are outlined: (1) expanding use of early childhood mental health consultants, (2) building effective partnerships with mental health and other community-based systems, (3) providing support and training for teachers, and (4) establishing family-based supports such as those provided by Head Start and Early Head Start. The article concludes with suggestions for research and policy changes to remove barriers and support this work."

The first goal of this study was to investigate the predictive power of fam- ily functioning for children’s psychological well-being. Second, differential sub-dimensions of family function- ing were examined in respect of their predictive power for children’s psychological adaptation. Third, coping strategies on the family system level were differentiated in terms of their predictive power both for family func- tioning and for children’s psychosocial adjustment. 58 families were included in the current study. The following instruments were used: Youth Self Report, Family Crisis Oriented Personal Scales, and Family Assessment Device. Family dysfunction as a whole positively correlates with psychological symptoms of adolescents; four sub-dimensions of family functioning predicted children’s problems, namely affective responsiveness, affective involvement, roles, and communication. This research is all the more informative as the studies on the subject are nearly inexistent, and since it focuses on a category of utmost value—children."

However, due to economic and other factors, they are unable to bring their children with them, thus giving rise to the problem of “stay-at-home children”. Stay-at-home children are not only a social problem, but also an educational problem. Among them, the mental health education of left-behind children is particularly prominent. Stay-at-home children are in an important stage of growth, and the current mental health problems of stay-at-home children are mainly low self-esteem, isolation, anorexia and other problems. In the face of these psychological problems, parents, schools, teachers and relevant government departments should pay attention to and put forward corresponding measures to alleviate the mental health problems of stay-at-home children, so as to create a favora-ble environment for the healthy growth of children."

This paper describes an in-progress DMHI using generative AI called Starfly. Starfly connects children with chronic illness with peers to facilitate positive interactions without stigma. The app offers a secure platform for social support and community building among young people managing chronic illness. By leveraging AI and thoughtful design, Starfly aims to promote mental well-being and improve disease outcomes in this vulnerable population."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/6527654,"Teenagers, Mental Health, Science Education, Preventive Actions","The aim of the current study is to investigate emotional and mental health changes causing psychiatric distress enough to affect the learning process of high school students. Students from three school years of a federal public school in Santa Maria County-RS-Brazil participated in the study. Ninety-four (94) out of 115 students answered the Self Report Questionnaire-SRQ-20, which is a World Health Organization (WHO) tool used worldwide in primary care level in order to identify Minor Mental or Psychiatric Disorders (MMD/MPD). The total of 32.98% of the participants recorded sufficient scores in psychological suffering. It is worth encouraging educators’ knowledge about mental health, as well as their continuous training through Educational Modules for emotional Promotion, Prevention and Learning, which are contextualized in the science-teaching content, as well as improving students’ information level on the subject. School is the strategically privileged territory for these actions, since it is the place where children and adolescents spend most of their time. Thus, it enables acquiring knowledge and empowering mental health promotion skills."

Scholars at home and abroad have conducted extensive research on left-behind children. This review is a comprehensive review of recent research papers in this field, and summarizes important research advances and main conclusions, indicating that left-behind experiences reduce children’s parent-child attachment levels, psychological resilience, self-esteem levels, increase loneliness, depression levels, anxiety levels, self-harming behaviors and the likelihood of suicide, and alter children’s brain structure and function. All sectors of society should work together to create conditions for parents to live together and improve children’s mental health."

In this paper, the relationship between vitamin D and children’s mental health is summarized, in order to reduce the incidence of mental disorders in children and provide reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/2856616,"Diagnosis, Mental Health Services Research, Informant Agreement, Child, Adolescent","This paper presents results from a three-part study on diagnosis of children with affective and behavior disorders. We examined the reliability, discriminant, and predictive validity of common diagnoses used in mental health services research using a research diagnostic interview. Results suggest four problems: a) some diagnoses demonstrate internal consistency only slightly better than symptoms chosen at random; b) diagnosis did not add appreciably to a brief global functioning screen in predicting service use; c) low inter-rater reliability among informants and clinicians for six of the most common diagnoses; and d) clinician diagnoses differed between sites in ways that reflect different reimbursement strategies. The study concludes that clinicians and researchers should not assume diagnosis is a useful measure of child and adolescent problems and outcomes until there is more evidence supporting the validity of diagnosis."

Previous studies have demonstrated associations between physical activity and mental health, but these studies did not include those populations in which training children have some traditional and religious aspects.Methods: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to compare the prevalence of mental health among those who had inactive, minimally and HEPA activity in a representative sample of adolescents aged 15-19 in South of Iran using data from the Mental Health Survey (n = 2584). The GHQ-28 and IPAQ-short forms were used to evaluate the mental health and physical activity, respectively .Results: A total of 2584 adolescents (1401 male and 1178 female) participated in the study. The observed odds of psychological symptoms in boys compared to girls is 1.2 times (p=0.018). We observed that HEPA-activity decreases odds of somatic distress and social dysfunction compared with inactivity (p=0.031 and 0.001, respectively); minimally activity decreases odds of anxiety compared with inactivity (p=0.038); but physical activity rate was not affected on odds of adolescents' depression (p>0.05).Conclusion: Physical activity decreases mental health subscales except for depression among adolescents in Boushehr, southern city of Iran."
https://www.oalib.com/paper/3111013,"Cognitive Behavioral Interventions, School Psychologists, Children’s Mental Health, Special  Education, Educational Settings",Cognitive behavioral interventions (CBIs) attempt to affect behavior change by teaching relevant tasks that are based around strategies to correct cognitive distortions through the application of logic and the search for evidence. Goals are clearly specified; decisions are made on how to best meet specified goals and how to measure progress toward goals to provide feedback. The intervention is task-oriented and focused on problem-solving. This article provides a brief review of the theoretical tenets of CBIs and use with children and adolescents. A review of the literature describes the efficacy and practical implementation of CBIs in school settings. An interdisciplinary collaborative framework is discussed to better support the implementation of school-based mental health programming in schools.
